\page interpreter_overview %Interpreter documentation.

The interpreter works like many standard interpreters by having a number of phases,
where each phase run through the Abstract Syntax Tree, modifies it, and computes
some values that are used in the next traversal.
In this interpreter, we first Parse the code, then we typecheck the code and finally we generate the llvm byte code.
